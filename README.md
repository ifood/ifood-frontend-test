### `Pattern and architecture details`

I used containers and components pattern where I fetch all the data inside the container and pass them to components via props.

 - React <br/>
    I choose react as it was recommended. Beside that, it is a popular and powerfull libraly for building single page web applications.

 - Redux <br/>
    I used Redux for managing my application state, even if it was not really necessary.

 - semantic_ui_react <br/>
    It is very good libraly for react application, and it has a very good documentation I used some components from their.

 - SASS <br/>
    Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into Cascading Style Sheets.
    Sass makes life easier as it allows us to nest our css selector the same way our html are nested.
    it also helps to write functions in css and declare reusable varibales.
